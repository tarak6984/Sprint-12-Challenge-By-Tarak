**Subject:** Application for Full-Stack Developer Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to apply for the *Full-Stack Developer* position at **Digitx**. With a solid foundation in the **MERN stack** and extensive hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end development, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your engineering team and help build scalable, high-performance digital solutions.

During my time as a **Full Stack Web Developer at IRays Teknology Ltd**, I spearheaded multiple feature releases that increased active users by over **300,000** and improved app retention by **200%** within six months. I have built and deployed end-to-end applications such as a **Healthcare Management Platform** using **Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Appwrite, and Twilio**, integrating real-time notifications, secure authentication, and scalable APIs. These experiences have made me highly proficient in **React, Node.js, Express, REST API design, authentication (JWT/OAuth), Docker deployment**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.

I am also well-versed in **Redux, Zustand, and React Hooks**, with strong familiarity in **Socket.IO** for real-time communication and **third-party API integrations** including Twilio and OpenAI. My work philosophy emphasizes performance, maintainability, and user-centric design — principles that align closely with Digitx's reputation for delivering innovative, high-quality software.

I take pride in being adaptable, dependable, and committed to meeting deadlines, even when challenges arise outside standard working hours. Having successfully led cross-functional teams, I am comfortable managing the entire software lifecycle — from ideation and architecture to testing, deployment, and maintenance.

I am very excited about the opportunity to bring my technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills to **Digitx**. I believe my background and drive for excellence would make me a strong fit for your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to Digitx's ongoing projects and future goals.

Warm regards,
**Tarak Md Shabbir**
