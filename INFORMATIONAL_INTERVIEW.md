The Tech Lead emphasized the critical importance of mastering fundamental programming concepts and computer science principles. Strong foundational knowledge in data structures, algorithms, and core language features is essential for solving complex problems effectively and building scalable solutions.

### 2. Understanding Why These Tech Stacks
It's not enough to just know how to use a technology—understanding *why* specific tech stacks are chosen for particular problems is crucial. This includes comprehending the trade-offs, performance characteristics, scalability considerations, and business requirements that drive technology decisions in real-world projects.

### 3. Less Reliance on AI
